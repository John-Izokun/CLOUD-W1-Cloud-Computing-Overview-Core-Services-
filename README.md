# Week [1]: [Repo Type Cloud] - [CLOUD COMPUTING]

**(Link to Main Portfolio Repo)**

**Objective:**
* o	Topics: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS definitions, AWS/GCP/Azure core compute/storage/networking service overview (EC2/Compute Engine, S3/GCS, VPC), Regions/AZs.
o	Task: Create Cloud-Fundamentals repo. README explains cloud models, core services with a comparison table, and basic cloud architecture diagrams.
o	Outcome: Documented understanding of cloud basics, ready to align with AI Project 1's context.

**Key Concepts / Technologies:**
* [List key terms, tools, libraries, algorithms: e.g., Python, FastAPI, Docker, CNNs, PyTorch, Terraform, AWS S3, CI/CD, Self-Attention]

**Related Weekly Repositories:**
* AI Task: [Link to `wX-ai-...` repo (if this is the Cloud repo, and vice-versa)]
* Cloud Task: [Link to `wX-cloud-...` repo]
* DevOps Practices: [Link to relevant section in `DevOps-Docs` if applicable]

**Implementation / Steps Taken:**
1.  [Brief description of step 1, e.g., Data Loading & Preprocessing]
2.  [Brief description of step 2, e.g., Terraform Configuration for S3]
3.  [...]

**Code Usage / Setup:**
* Prerequisites: [e.g., Python 3.9, Conda, Docker, Terraform v1.x]
* Setup: `conda env create -f environment.yml` or `pip install -r ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dee00223-b429-46dc-868c-92a25ef6a538)
* requirements.txt`
* Execution:
    ```bash
    # Example: Run training script
    python train.py --config config.yaml

    # Example: Apply Terraform
    terraform init && terraform apply

    # Example: Build and run Docker container
    docker build -t weekX-app .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 weekX-app
    ```

**Results / Outputs:**
* [Include key metrics, e.g., Model Accuracy: 92%]
* [Link to W&B/MLflow Run: `https://...`]

* [Link to deployed API endpoint if applicable]

**Integration Activity & Paper Insights:**
* **Paper:** [Paper Title] ([Link to your summary in `Project-Titan/Research-Papers/weekX-summary.md`])
* **Connection:** [Explicitly describe how the paper's concepts were applied or relate to this week's AI and/or Cloud tasks. Reference the specific "Integrated Activity" mentioned in `research paper 3.docx`. E.g., "Implemented train/test split rigorously as emphasized by Domingos (2012)..." or "Used Boto3 script developed in Cloud task Wk2 to fetch test data from S3 for Binary Search validation..."]

**Challenges & Learnings:**
* [Briefly note any significant hurdles and key personal takeaways.]

**(Optional) Badges:**
* [e.g., ![CI Status](link-to-github-actions-badge)]
